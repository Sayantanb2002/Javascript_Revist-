# 🔁 Revisiting JavaScript Fundamentals 🚀

Welcome to my **JavaScript Fundamentals Refresh** repository!
This is where I revisited core JS concepts to strengthen my base, improve my problem-solving skills, and deepen my understanding of how JavaScript really works under the hood.
Whether you're starting out or brushing up — feel free to explore! ✨

## 📚 What’s Inside?

A structured collection of JavaScript fundamentals, including:

### 🔹 **Variables & Scope**

* `let` vs `const` vs `var`

* Common array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.)
* Object manipulation techniques
* Deep vs shallow copy basics

### 🔹 **Asynchronous JavaScript**

* `setTimeout`, `setInterval` ⏱️
* Promises
* Async/Await 🤝

### 🔹 **Prototypes & OOP**

## 🤝 Why I Built This

I wanted a clean, organized space to re-master the fundamentals — something I can revisit anytime and also share with learners who want the same clarity.
Strong fundamentals = strong developer foundation 💪.
